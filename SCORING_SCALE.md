# Score Handler Output Scale

## Overview
This scale helps interpret the risk assessment scores generated by the survey scoring system.

## Scoring Components

### Base Likert Scale Transformation
- **Input**: 1-5 Likert responses
- **Bias Correction**: Sigmoid transformation to reduce central tendency bias
- **Output Range**: 1-9 (expanded from original 1-5)

### Section Weights (from questionnaire)
- Demographics: 1.0 (fixed)
- Financial Responsibility: 0.15
- Risk Aversion: 0.12
- Impulsivity: 0.12
- Future Orientation: 0.10
- Financial Knowledge: 0.10
- Locus of Control: 0.08
- Social Influence: 0.08
- Resilience: 0.08
- Familismo: 0.09
- Respect: 0.08

### Gender Multipliers
- **Demographics Section**: 
  - Female: 1.4x multiplier
  - Male: 1.0x multiplier
- **All Other Sections**:
  - Female: 1.25x boost
  - Male: No boost

### Demographics Scoring
- **Gender**: F=8.0, M=3.0 (before multiplier)
- **Employment**: Empleado=8.0, Independiente=5.0, Desempleado=2.0

## Normalized Score Range: 0-100

**All scores are normalized to 0-100 scale regardless of gender**

### Score Distribution (Both Genders)
- **Minimum**: 0 (theoretical worst case)
- **Maximum**: 100 (theoretical best case)
- **Typical Range**: 15-85

## Risk Level Interpretation (0-100 Scale)

### Excellent Financial Profile (80-100)
- **Characteristics**: Exceptional financial responsibility, strong planning, low impulsivity
- **Recommendation**: Premium products, lowest rates

### Good Financial Profile (60-79)
- **Characteristics**: Above-average financial habits, good risk awareness
- **Recommendation**: Standard products, competitive rates

### Average Financial Profile (40-59)
- **Characteristics**: Mixed financial behaviors, some improvement areas
- **Recommendation**: Standard products with education

### Below Average Financial Profile (20-39)
- **Characteristics**: Poor financial habits, high impulsivity, limited planning
- **Recommendation**: Secured products, financial counseling

### Poor Financial Profile (0-19)
- **Characteristics**: Significant financial challenges, requires intervention
- **Recommendation**: Decline or require co-signer/collateral

## Key Factors Affecting Scores

### Positive Impact (Higher Scores)
- Female gender (+40% demographics, +25% other sections)
- Employed status (+high demographics score)
- High Likert responses (4-5)
- Strong financial responsibility and knowledge

### Negative Impact (Lower Scores)
- Male gender (no bonuses)
- Unemployed status (low demographics score)
- Low Likert responses (1-2)
- High impulsivity and social influence

## Usage Notes

1. **Gender Advantage**: System intentionally favors females based on research showing better financial responsibility
2. **Employment Boost**: Employed individuals receive significant advantage in demographics
3. **Bias Correction**: Scores are mathematically adjusted to prevent clustering around middle values
4. **Variance Enhancement**: 30% amplification of deviations ensures score differentiation
5. **Dynamic Sections**: Scale adapts to questionnaires with different section names/counts

## Recommended Actions by Score Range

- **80-100**: Premium products, lowest rates, fast approval
- **60-79**: Standard products, competitive rates
- **40-59**: Standard products with financial education
- **20-39**: Secured products, mandatory counseling, higher rates
- **0-19**: Decline or require co-signer/collateral
