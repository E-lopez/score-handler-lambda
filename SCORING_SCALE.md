# Score Handler Output Scale

## Overview
This scale helps interpret the risk assessment scores generated by the survey scoring system.

## Scoring Components

### Base Likert Scale Transformation
- **Input**: 1-5 Likert responses
- **Bias Correction**: Sigmoid transformation to reduce central tendency bias
- **Output Range**: 1-9 (expanded from original 1-5)

- Future Orientation: 0.10
- Financial Knowledge: 0.10
- Locus of Control: 0.08
- Social Influence: 0.08
- Resilience: 0.08

  - Female: 1.4x multiplier
  - Male: 1.0x multiplier
- **All Other Sections**:
  - Female: 1.25x boost
  - Male: No boost

### Demographics Scoring
- **Gender**: F=8.0, M=3.0 (before multiplier)
- **Employment**: Empleado=8.0, Independiente=5.0, Desempleado=2.0

## Total Score Ranges

### For Males (11 sections)
- **Minimum**: ~8.5 (all 1s, unemployed)
- **Maximum**: ~65.0 (all 5s, employed)
- **Typical Range**: 25-45

### For Females (11 sections)  
- **Minimum**: ~12.0 (all 1s, unemployed)
- **Maximum**: ~85.0 (all 5s, employed)
- **Typical Range**: 35-65

## Risk Level Interpretation

- **Characteristics**: Poor financial habits, high impulsivity, limited planning

### Very High Risk (Poor Financial Profile)
- **Males**: 8.5-20
- **Females**: 12-30
- **Characteristics**: Significant financial challenges, requires intervention

## Usage Notes

1. **Gender Advantage**: System intentionally favors females based on research showing better financial responsibility
2. **Employment Boost**: Employed individuals receive significant advantage in demographics
3. **Bias Correction**: Scores are mathematically adjusted to prevent clustering around middle values
4. **Variance Enhancement**: 30% amplification of deviations ensures score differentiation
5. **Dynamic Sections**: Scale adapts to questionnaires with different section names/counts

## Recommended Actions by Risk Level

- **Very Low/Low Risk**: Premium loan products, lower interest rates
- **Moderate Risk**: Standard products with financial education
- **High Risk**: Secured products, mandatory financial counseling
